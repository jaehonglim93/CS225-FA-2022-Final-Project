# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We are going to meet twice each week: Tuesday 3PM, Saturday 3PM. The meetings should last upto 2 hours. We are going to hold meetings in person. Each person will use their own computers to take notes.
2. **Assistance** 
We have created a group chat through messages. We should reply to each other as soon as possible.
3. **Respect** 
Let everyone speak if they have ideas without interuptions. We will ask each other for input if they are quiet.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will divide the workload equally according to each person's interests or strengths as much as possible. We will communicate with each other through group chat or in the meetings to address unexpected complications.
5. **Time Commitment** 
For each member, 6 hours of work per week is expected, including the meeting times. We will address new conflicts through group chat, and change plans accordingly.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If we have divided opinions, we should comprimise through discussion. Other people should help out the member who was not able to accomlish his tasks. If one or more members are constantly late, we should discuss to change the meeting time.
